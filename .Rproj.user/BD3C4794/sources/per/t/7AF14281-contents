## Regression

The main goal of regression analysis is to see how a set of independent variables explain the variation of a dependent variables. In its simplest form, we would have a multiple linear regression of the form:

$Y_{i} = \beta_{0} + \beta_{1}X_{1i}+...+\beta_{k}X_{ki} + \varepsilon_{i}$

# Assumptions OLS:

1) Normality
2) Exogeneity
3) Lack of perfect multicollinearity
4) Homoscedasticity
5) Independence of errors
6) Linearity

```{r regression, echo=FALSE}

# We are deleting the missing values since they are by definition not included in the regression.
#dat_reg1 <- na.omit(dat[,c("trstplt", "agea", "gender", "educ")])
#dat_reg1

# Reg 1.
# DV: From 0 to 10, how much do you trust in politicians?

# IV: age, gender, educ 
#reg1 <- lm(trstplt ~ agea + gender + educ, data = dat_reg1)
#summary(reg1)

# How do we interpret these results?

# Plot regression


# Reg 2.
# IV: age, gender, education, political interest,
#table(dat$polintr)


# Assumptions



```
